<p>Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Jinyang, but I go by Alice. Iâ€™m currently an incoming senior studying computer science at the <strong><a href="https://www.cs.washington.edu/">University of Washington</a></strong>, as well as a software engineering intern at <strong><a href="https://adobe.com/">Adobe</a></strong> where I am tinkering with intelligent audio editing. Previously, I led and shipped a new login & signup experience at <strong><a href="https://asana.com/">Asana</a></strong> and built an app for anime fans at <strong><a href="https://www.meta.com/">Meta</a></strong>.</p>
<p>I enjoy hand-building ceramics, writing Yelp reviews, attending jazz concerts, and solving sudokus.<p>
